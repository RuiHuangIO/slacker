When I first started learning web development, I thought following a tutorial on a relatively large project from beginning to end would be the best way to learn.

At the time, one tutorial that stood out to me was [this](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN3n1USn4xlkdRlq3VZ1sT6SGW0-yajjL). At the time, I didn't know enough to effectively follow this tutorial to learn everything. I think I am finally ready for it now.
